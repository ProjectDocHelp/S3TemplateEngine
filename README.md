## Motivation
AWS S3 and AWS Cloudfront offer a great platform to publish websites and web apps at a low cost. However, you need to create static HTML files elsewhere, and getting everything up and running can be a pain without a decent CMS.

**This project is for you, if** you want to manually create HTML and benefit from low-cost serverless computing but still want to:
 * Reuse code snippets (like header or navigation)
 * Use a CMS for updating your content
 * Automatically create pages dynamically (like an individual page for each article you put in a system, rather than an SEO unfriendly AJAX load of content on a generic page)
 * Have a pipeline that optimizes/minifies your code output

## Known non-intuitive behaviour
 * When you updateyour content (by changing the temnplante files or Webiny items), **your changes will not instantly appear on your website URL**. The reason for that is, that, if you set up everything as descibed below, your Domain routes to CloudFront, and CloudFront caches files. I recommend using your S3 bucket (https://<your environment (as enetred in cloudformation)>-website-<you website name (as enetred in cloudformation)>.s3.<your region, as choosen in AWS>.amazonaws.com/index.html) for preview and using the "invalidation" feature of CloudFront (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Invalidation.html) once you are happy with your changes.


## Concept
S3TemplateEngine uses serverless technologies (S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, Cloudformation) to provide a straightforward but powerful template language. 

All you have to do is follow the installation paragraph, and you can write your HTML-based templates, put them into a specific S3 bucket and see the magic happen.

## Useage
Just put your template (usual website files, html with the additional commands shown below) in the "prod-website-code-\<your page name\>" s3 bucket. The system will behave as follows:

**Content from the following folders will be synced (copied or deleted) to the output S3 bucket:**
 * files/ (usually used for downloads like pdfs)
 * gfx/ (usually used for visuals used on the website and css files)
 * js/ (used for javascript files) 

**Content from the following folders will be processed with the commands shown below:**
 * website/ (will be the root of the output folder)
   * The following files are madatory:
     * index.html (your main page)
     * 404.html (your error page)
 * part/   

**Other folders and files int the root will be ignored**

## Commands
Inside the files you put into "website/" and "part/", you can use the following tags:
<details>
  <summary> &lt;part&gt; - Reusing code from other files</summary>
 
### Action
Renders a certain code only, if a condition is met. Currently the only available condition is the environment. This is handy, if you want to have different "robots" meta tags for your produciton environment, than for dev and stage.
### Syntax
```html
<part>*name*</part>
```
Whereas *name* is a filename or path/filename inside the "part/" directory.
### Example
```html
    <head>
        <part>head.part</part>
    </head>
```

</details>
<details>
  <summary> &lt;if&gt; - Only render code, if you are in a certain environment</summary>

### Action
Replaces the command with the content from another file. This is handy, if you want to reuse HTML headers or navigation.
### Syntax
```html
<part>*json*</part>
```
Whereas *json* is a is a json object with the following attributes:
```json
{
  "env": "match the current environment dev|stage|prod",
  "file": "match the rendered filename e.g. index.html",
  "not": true|false - if true invert result of other machtes,
  "template": "an HTML template, that will either appear or not appear"
}
```
Whereas *env*, *file* and *not* are optional (but the whole command only makes sense, if you use at least one of them).
### Example
```html
    <if>{
        "env": "dev",
        "template": "<meta name='robots' content='noindex'><meta name='googlebot' content='noindex'>"
      }</if>
    <if>{
        "env": "stage",
        "template": "<meta name='robots' content='noindex'><meta name='googlebot' content='noindex'>"
      }</if>      
    <if>{
      "env": "prod",
      "template": "<meta name='robots' content='all'><meta name='googlebot' content='all'>"
    }</if>
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary> &lt;fileattribute&gt; - Inserts file attributs (also Webiny items values, based on dbmultifile loop created files)</summary>
 
### Action
Replaces the \<fileattribute\>-command with the current filename. Handy for generation of canonical tags.<br><br>Also works inside a \<dbmultifile\>-command: 
### Syntax
```html
<fileattribute>filename</fileattribute>
```
Currently filename is the only command available.
### Example
```html
<fileattribute>filename</fileattribute>
```
</details>

## Optional: Webiny integration

### Concept of optional Webiny extension
S3TemplateEngine supports Webiny as an editors interface. Webiny ( https://www.webiny.com/ ), an open source serverless CMS ranging from a free version up to enterprise grade, also uses serverless technologies from AWS. We integrate it without any code change in Webiny, by accessing the published items on database level. So you it goes with a vanilla installation as well as with a highly cusomized one.  

All you have to do is to follow the installation paragraph, and you can use your Webiny generated content in your HTML-based templates.

![Architecture_with_Webiny](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100029932/174443536-7af050de-eea7-4456-81aa-a173863b6ec9.png)

### Installation of optional Webiny extension
<details>
  <summary>Intall S3TemplateEngine.</summary>

   * Install S3TemplateEngine, as described in the [Installation](#Installation) paragraph.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Intall Webiny.</summary>

   * Install Webiny, as described in the Webiny documentation. ( https://www.webiny.com/docs/get-started/install-webiny )
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Prepare Webiny.</summary>

   * Log in and create the models you need in the Webiny backend. The names of these models will be needed for the following steps.
   * **Hint: If you want to add or remove a model after installation, you can do so by manually editing the of the "relevant_webiny_models" environment variable of the "<ENV>_HOK_transfer_published_item" lambda function.**
   * In addition, create the following two models:
     * model name "staticCodeContent", containing
       * a text field called "contentid" with the restriction "unique"
       * a long text field "content"
         * This model will be used for specific conetent you only have one instance of, that is source code, like a tracking pixel   
         * It will be available via it's "contentid", if you want to hand these over to editors, I recommend prepareing the available contentid values as predefined value
     * model name "staticContent", containing
       * a text field called "contentid" with the restriction "unique"
       * a rich text field "content"
         * This one will be used for specific conetent you only have one instance of, like the "about us" page
         * It will be available via it's "contentid", if you want to hand these over to editors, I recommend prepareing the available contentid values as predefined value

### Commands of optional Webiny extension
Inside the files you put into "website/" and "part/", you can use the following tags:
<details>
  <summary> &lt;dbpart&gt; - Inserting code or content maintained in Webiny</summary>
 
### Action
Replaces the command with the content from an Webiny maintained element. This is handy, if you want to give an editor access to static elements like a privacy statement or a tracking tag.
### Syntax
```html
<dbpart>*name*</dbpart>
```
Whereas *name* is the "contentid" of a Webiny "Static Contents" or "Static Code Contents" element.
### Example
```html
    <body>
        <dbpart>impressum</dbpart>
    </body>
```
</details>
<details>
  <summary> &lt;dbmulti&gt; - Inserting multiple Webiny items in one file</summary>
 
### Action
Replaces the command with a defined HTML template multiple times. Exactly once for each entry in the published Webiny content, matching the filter criteria. Handy for cretaing an overview page of articles.
### Syntax
```html
<dbmulti>*json*</dbmulti>
```
Whereas *json* is a json object with the following attributes:
```json
{
  "filter":[
    {"AttributeName":{"DynamoDBType":"AttributeContent"}},
    ...
  ],
  "template":"an HTML template, that will probably contain <dbitem> elements"
}
```
__Hint:__ You can sort entries by adding a number field named "order" to your Webiny model. After that edit your entries: smaller numbers come first, stuff with empty "order" fields are rendered at the end.

### Example
```html
<dbmulti>{
    "filter":[{"forWebsite":{"BOOL":true}}],
    "template":"<a href='artikeldetail-<dbitem>id</dbitem>.html'><h2><dbitem>headline</dbitem></h2><div class='content'><dbitem>readingtime</dbitem>&nbsp;min</div></a>"
}</dbmulti>
```
</details>
<details>
  <summary> &lt;dbmultifile&gt; - Create a file for each Webiny item matching a filter</summary>

### Action
Creates multiple files out of one template file, by using one unqiue database attribute as suffix to the created filenames. Handy for generating individual pages for articles.
### Syntax
Must be first line of the tmeplate frile (even before \<!Doctype html\>)
```html
<dbmultifile>*json*</dbmultifile>
```
Whereas *json* is a json object with the following attributes:
```json
{
  "filenamesuffix":"Dynamo DB field (muust be unique)",
  "filter":[
    {"AttributeName":{"DynamoDBType":"AttributeContent"}},
    ...
  ]
}
```
Whereas *fieldname* is the name of an attribute (column) from the DynamoDB

### Example
```html
<dbmultifile>{
    "filenamesuffix":"id",
    "filter":[
      {"__typename":{"S":"artikel"}}
    ]
  }</dbmultifile>
```
</details>
<details>
  <summary> &lt;dbitem&gt; - Inserts Webiny items values (used inside a dbmulti or dbmultifile loop)</summary>
 
### Action
Inside a \<dbmulti\>-command or \<dbmultifile\>-command: Replaces the \<dbitem\>-command with the content of a Webiny field of the current element.
### Syntax
```html
<dbitem>*fieldname*</dbitem>
```
Whereas *fieldname* is the name of an attribute (column) from the DynamoDB.
### Example
```html
<dbitem>headline</dbitem>
```
